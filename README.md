# Collins-et-al_NE-R000875-1_obj1_mRNA-seq_scripts

This repository contains the scripts and files needed to reproduce the analysis of, "Costs of reproduction are present but latent in eusocial bumblebee queens" by David H. Collins, David C. Prince, Jenny L. Donelan, Tracey Chapman, and Andrew F. G. Bourke, published in BMC Biology.  

The csv files "aggression", "BORIS_video", "cells", "numbers", "queen_measurements", "survival" and "Virus", together with the R scripts with names starting "NER0008751_Obj1_Exp1" are needed to reproduce the "Queen fertility and colony fertility" and the "Queen longevity, worker aggression, worker additions and removals, and queen activity/response to disturbance" sections of the results. 

The csv files "chen_2014_table_s1", "korb_2021_table_s1", "kramer_2021_table_s3", "pacifico_2018_table_s1_female" and "virus_samples", along with the text files "md5sums_holobee" and "00_introduction", and the scripts with names starting with two digits (e.g. "01_initiate_directory_structure.bash) or "f_" (e.g. "f_CustomPCAPlot.R") are needed to reproduce the "Age-related gene expression", "Gene Ontology", "Gene expression analysis: comparisons with age- and ageing-related genes from other species" and "Gene expression analysis: relative versus chronological age" sections of the results.
